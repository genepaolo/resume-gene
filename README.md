## No JS Interactive Resume

This is an interactive resume that I created without the use of JavaScript.

### Description

This is a small project that I worked on briefly around the end of March 2022. I wanted to see how much I can do using only HTML, CSS, and SASS without Bootstrap or Javascript. I never truly appreciated Javascript until you aren’t able to change the style of components that aren’t children nodes. Although it is a small project, I kept everything clean using BEM (Block Element Modifier) and the 7-1 Architecture under CSS with SASS. The code is set up to allow for tabs to be added/removed if needed so there isn’t just 6 tabs placed statically.
